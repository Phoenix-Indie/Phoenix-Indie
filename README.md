- 👋 Hi, I’m @Phoenix-Indie
- 👀 I’m interested in almost anything creative, though here I'm primarily focusing on gamedev.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Godot game engine, trying to make my first complete game.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, though maybe a game in the future once I've finished my first one.
- 📫 How to reach me: phnxindie@gmail.com for direct email, https://www.youtube.com/@phnxindie for devlogs and random videos.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have no idea what I'm doing, which means that I'm learning and progressing. We ball.
